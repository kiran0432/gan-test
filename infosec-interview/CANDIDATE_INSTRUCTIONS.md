# Coolbet Security Engineer - Task

The goal of this task is to demonstrate the general knowledge about some of the foundational topics that as engineers, we face everyday. 

The code in this exercise represents a very basic API that allows for user registration, login and collection of information. As engineers, it is common to have the necessity of securing unfamiliar pieces of the organization's systems, and the main ability that this exercise is aiming to demonstrate is to provide useful security guidance even when encountering unknown systems, through the use of various testing methodologies.

## Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to find security issues in this repository.

Such issues can be vulnerabilities of any kind, including compliance issues, and can be found using any method of choice, including white box, black box, static and dynamic analysis. 

To complete the exercise, provide a PDF report containing:

* The vulnerabilities found
* The impact of each vulnerability (from a high-level point of view only)
* Possible remediations or recommendations for each vulnerability
* A suggestion for the main vulnerability/issue that you recommend should be fixed (i.e., a suggestion for a prioritization of the vulnerabilities)

The format of the report is free and will not be taken in consideration when evaluating the exercise, as long as the information is presented clearly.
